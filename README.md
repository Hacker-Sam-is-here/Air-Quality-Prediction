# Air Quality Prediction

## Description
This project aims to predict air quality levels using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing pollution data to train a model that can forecast air quality levels. The trained model can be used to make predictions based on new input data.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To make predictions on air quality, run the following command:
```bash
python air_quality_prediction.py
```
Ensure that the `updated_pollution_dataset.csv` file is in the same directory, as it may be used for loading data.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
